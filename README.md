**ChickHead** is a 2D platformer game developed as a high school research project. Built with the **Godot Engine**, it features a unique neural network integration (in specific branches/versions) and classic platforming mechanics.

## 🎮 About the Project

This repository contains the source code and assets for the ChickHead game. The project explores game development concepts, including:
- **Tilemap-based Level Design**: Intricate cyberpunk-themed levels.
- **Physics-based Movement**: Smooth player controls and interactions.
- **Neural Network Integration**: Experimental AI implementation (see `Scripts/` for logic).

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows to keep the workspace clean and intuitive:

- **`Scenes/`**: Contains all the game scenes (`.tscn`), including levels, menus, and player prefabs.
- **`Scripts/`**: Holds all the GDScript files (`.gd`) that power the game logic.
- **`Resources/`**: Stores game assets like sprites, fonts, audio, and tilemaps.
    - **`Backgrounds/`**: Parallax backgrounds and environmental art.
- **`docs/`**: Documentation and research papers related to the project.
- **`exports/`**: Web builds and other exported versions of the game.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Godot Engine 4.x**: Download the latest version from the [official website](https://godotengine.org/).

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chickhead.git
   ```
2. **Import into Godot**:
   - Open Godot Engine.
   - Click **Import**.
   - Navigate to the cloned folder and select the `project.godot` file.
   - Click **Open**.

### Running the Game
- Press **F5** to play the main scene.
- Use the arrow keys or WASD to move the character.

## 🛠️ Built With
